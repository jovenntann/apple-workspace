✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨


## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve apple-workspace`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!


## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)

The flowchart describes the architecture of an application structured into multiple layers, including Contracts, Client, Controller, Service, and Data layers. Here's a detailed breakdown:

Contracts Layer:
- Contract: This is the source of truth for the entire application, providing the core contracts or interfaces that the rest of the system adheres to.
- Product Management: A subset of the Contract dealing specifically with products.
- User Management: Another subset of the Contract that deals specifically with users.

Client Layer:
- Products Client: Utilizes the "Contract" as the reference for interacting with product data.
- User Client: Similarly, it uses the "Contract" as the basis for dealing with user data.

Controller Layer:
- Products Controller: This is responsible for handling product-related requests. It also uses the "Contract" as a standard.
- Users Controller: Manages user-related operations and, like the Products Controller, adheres to the "Contract."

Service Layer:
- Backend Service Products Service: A service that does the actual business logic for product management. It interacts with a DynamoDB service for data storage and retrieval. It also aligns with the "Contract."
- Backend Service User Service: Responsible for user management and also interacts with the DynamoDB service. It too uses the "Contract" as a guide.

Data Layer:
- DynamoDb Service: This service is responsible for all interactions with the database.
- Dynamo: Represents the actual DynamoDB client used for database operations.

Additional Notes:
- The Controllers use the Backend Services for executing business logic.
- The architecture is designed in such a way that each layer has a specific role and responsibility, contributing to a modular, maintainable, and scalable system. It heavily relies on contracts as the source of truth, ensuring uniformity and coherence throughout the application.
